    <h1>FAQs</h1>

		<h2><a name="what">What does The Super Times app do?</a></h2>
	
		<p>The Super Times is a weekly audio magazine which sends subscribers the best audio programmes we can find.</p>
	
		<h2><a name="editions">What does each edition of The Super Times contain?</a></h2>
	
    <p>Super programmes, and lots of them!... in fact enough listening to fill the average weekly commute.</p>

		<p>Each edition contains 6 categories; Zeitgeist, Life, Books, Culture, Brain Bending and Science.</p>
	
    <p>- <b style="color:#000">Zeitgeist</b> contains programmes which feature current issues, wether this is about recent world affairs or the latest film releases.</p> 
    <p>- <b style="color:#000">Life</b> contains lots of true life stories covering the full spectrum of human emotion and experience.</p>
    <p>- <b style="color:#000">Books</b> contains programmes of literary interest, including book readings, interviews with authors and book reviews.</p>
    <p>- <b style="color:#000">Culture</b> contains the best programmes on design, art, lifestyle, comedy and more. </p>
    <p>- The <b style="color:#000">Brain Bending</b> category just simply boggles the mind.</p>
    <p>- <b style="color:#000">Science</b> features all the curious discoveries and illuminating ideas from the scientific world.</p>

    <h2><a name="why">Why?</a></h2>
    <p>
      From a personal perspective the two humans that made The Super Times simply love listening to great audio - stories, dramas, documentaries &amp; the odd bit of whimsical banter.  Having exhausted the obvious places to find these types of programmes we felt there must be more great and diverse stuff out there - and ooooh, yes, indeed there was!
    </p>
    <p>
      However, we didn't only find lots of amazing stuff but we found a lot of noise too.  Over the past year or so we have investigated several ways to organise through this noise and find the best audio programmes which has culminated in The Super TImes app.  We really made this for ourselves, as much as a great way for others to listen too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike subscribing to several feeds you get a much more diverse range of audio without overwhelming your mobile device and yourself with a tonne of podcasts to catch up on.  We have also engineered the app to allow for fast syncing so that you can quickly sync while you're online and enjoy listening anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      As busy people we simply didn't have the time to find new and interesting audio to download onto our phones for our long London commutes and we made The Super Times solves to solve this problem.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="free-edition">How do I know if I will like the audio programmes you've picked?</a></h2>

    <p>
      You can download The Super Times from the app store and we give you a free edition to try out before you commit to subscribing.  We are very picky about things like audio quality and content - so when we feature a programme by a shy and retiring lady with a make shift sound recording studio in the corner of her bedroom, we make sure that it maintains the high standard of programmes we like to listen to.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="subscription">Why do I need to subscribe?</a></h2>

    <p>
      We are serious about building a quality audio service for mobile use.  Simply it costs us money to design and develop the experience as well as support the infrastructure for the ongoing weekly editions.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's also important to the two humans that built The Super Times to be directly liable to you and the best way for this to happen is for you to pay us and be our customers.  We'd rather NOT sell your status as a user to the Vogons or try and cross-sell you salt air treatments!
    </p>

    <h2><a name="subscription-error">Why am I getting a failure error when trying to subscribe?</a></h2>
    <p>
      Apple handles all subscription payment processing and from time to time this may give you back an error.  Although we can't identify what the specific error may be you should check your Apple account and if you continue to have problems then get in touch with Apple.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="subscription-not-completing">Why is my subscription not completing?</a></h2>
    <p>
      You need to be connected to the internet for your subscription to complete.  If you've lost internet connection and your subscription payment has already been processed by Apple then we will show the <b style="color:#000">complete your subscription</b> button at the bottom of each screen of the app, click on this to complete your subscription when you are back online.
    </p>
    <p>
      On rare occasions we may experience a problem with our servers in which instance we will contact you to inform you of this.
    </p>
		
		<h2><a name="supported-devices">What devices does The Super Times app support?</a></h2>
	
		<p>The app is optimised for use on an iPhone 4+ and will therefore also be compatible with iPads and 4th generation iPod touch.  We currently support iOS 5.1+.</p>

    <h2><a name="feature-requests">Will you add (said) feature?</a></h2>

    <p>
      Maybe.  We are just 2 humans building this product and so time is very limited, however if it's a useful feature that enough people request then we'll consider it.  There are also services and apps that already cater to other types of functionality that may not be a focus for us, so we won't be fulfilling every feature request sent our way. <b  style="color:#000">Our focus is simple - super content, super fast and sticking to this is our first priority</b>.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="archived-editions">Can I listen to a programme aired in a previous edition?</a></h2>

    <p>
      Not for now.  The app is designed like a magazine and with the expiration of each edition we clean up all associated content in preparation for your new edition.  This means that you will never end up with a backlog of programmes taking up space on your iPhone or be overwhelmed with content.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="funding">Funding?</a></h2>

    <p>
      The Super Times app has no outside funding or corporate backing.  It's a business run by two regular humans, therefore the aim is to generate income to cover it's costs.  This income comes entirely from subscription accounts.
    </p>  

    <p>If you would like to support The Super Times, the best way to do it is by downloading the app and subscribing to weekly editions.</p>

    <p>It's also a huge help if you spread the word by telling your friends about The Super Times.  Thank you for your support.</p>
